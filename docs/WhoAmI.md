# Docs Directory WhoAmI
Purpose: Human-readable context to amplify Copilot effectiveness (intent, usage practices, decisions).

Key Files:
- `project-intent.md` – vision, users, goals, constraints.
- `copilot-usage.md` – how to collaborate with Copilot effectively.
- (Future) ADRs: add under `docs/adr/` with incremental numbering.

Usage:
- Keep intent file updated when direction or constraints shift.
- Link to docs in PR descriptions for larger changes.

TODO:
- [ ] Add adr/ directory if architectural decisions begin.
- [ ] Add onboarding checklist.
- [ ] Add security & performance guideline docs if scope expands.
